# Database
The file is grouped by title game and console, and the main columns are game title, console, total_sales, critic_score and release_date.


# Software
Made on Power BI 2.130.930.0 (june 2024)

# Dashboard
In interest to get the most interesting insights from the database, I divided the dashboard in 3 sheets: General: which shows an overall perspective of data 
Consoles: visuals of data grouped by consoles. The main approach is to show data of the 4 consoles with most games sold: PS2, X360, PS3 and PS1, as well as the most relevant games in which console in terms of sales, its evaluation grade and genres. 
Games: visuals of data grouped by games title. I grouped the most relevant games in terms of sales by its franchise. For example, GTA 4 and 5 were signed as GTA franchise. This was not made for all game title, just for the most relevants. This sheet still shows the quantity of games sold by year and its evaluation grades.

# Working on
I'd like that visuals in console and games sheet show the values sorted descending when filtered by category.
